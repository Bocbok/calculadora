# Readme Calculadora

## Simplicity choices

To implement this calculator I choosed to use the postfix algorithm to directly calculate from an infix equation.

Moreover I assume that the user will enter valid operations and will not try to break the application.

Finally for the scientific function, I choosed for simplicity to evaluate the actual expression and then apply the function.

# Portrait mode

$12 + 9.8 * (1 - 7.2)$

# Landscape mode

$ln(2+3*(4.5/8.2))$

 then we apply $ln$ to this expression

$cos(1.5) * 2 + 3 / 8$

Due to my simplifications choices I first need to calculate $cos(1.5)$ and then add the rest of the expression.
